"description": "ACAP Saint Johnâ€™s Water Quality Monitoring Programs aim to build upon the community-based water monitoring program established in 1992 in the Greater Saint John Area. The data collected from these various monitoring programs is used to track stressors, determine restoration sites, strengthen/shape policy, and expand community partnerships. Water temperature is logged in various watercourses across the Greater Saint John using temperature logger deployed for months at a time.",
